Well done!

a) -0.25
You were asked to find count, so it would be better to have a COUNT in the select. In that case GROUP BY would not be needed.

b) -1
You're filtering 3 max by top+order by. You don't need to add MAX . GROUP BY will also be cancelled then.

c) -1
You don't need product name or id. It should be just one weight and one size - two columns. Also, why did you decide to add a condition for weight in WHERE. 

d) -1
What was the reason of adding Weight and Color in GROUP BY? :(
Also, don't use ORDER BY if it's not asked.

e)-1
The same.
Also, color is not asked in the select, so it's not needed in the GROUP BY too.


Please, stop editing tasks. You need to solve exactly what is stated.
