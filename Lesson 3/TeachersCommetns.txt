You don't have the parentheses in the WHERE clause. It gives you the incorrect result at all. OR condition messes up everything.
Correct answer:
...WHERE StandardPrice>10 
		AND (Name LIKE '%X%'
			OR 
			Name LIKE 'N%')
      
c) -0.5
It would be better to use DISTINCT, not GROUP BY to have unique rows. The result will be equal, but the query run - not.
Also, it would be better to have ID IS NULL in WHERE clause, not qty. We never know can Qty column be null by itself.

FROM Production.Product p JOIN sales.SpecialOfferProduct sp ON p.ProductID=sp.ProductID
GROUP BY p.Name
HAVING COUNT(sp.SpecialOfferID) >1
